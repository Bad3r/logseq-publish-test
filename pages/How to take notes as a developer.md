- ## Write notes in your own words
	- When studying and making notes, a common approach is to copy down definitions of things straight from the textbook or learning resource that you are using. If you’re attending a lecture or listening to a course online, and are a super-fast typist, you might even be able to directly quote what your instructor is saying straight into your notes.
	- The problem that comes with writing notes this way is that you’ve been able to skip the work of actually understanding the content. If you go back and re-read your notes a couple of times, this will create the illusion of understanding (as you will be able to recall bits of it in your memory) but saying it in your own words takes a bit more thought and brainpower to do.
	- When writing your notes, it is important that you do the work upfront of understanding the meaning, by making sure they’re written in your own words. This will save you the hassle of trying to understand it later.
- ## Start with the journal page
	- You probably will have some sort of notebook (whether it’s paper-based or digital) where you jot down all your notes. If you’re organised, you may even have some sort of tagging system too! Keeping notes is good practice, but problems can arise depending on what you do with the notes after you’ve written them.
	- Over time as you learn and note down new things, your collection of notes will grow bigger and bigger. It can start to be a bit overwhelming, especially if your notes are disjointed and all over the place without much clear organisation. If you’re looking through your notes for a new topic to blog about, it may be hard to find something worth blogging about.
	  Even worse - you may have documented the solution to a particularly gnarly problem you solved at work (which would make for some great blog content!) but after coming back to it later you’re finding it hard to turn it into a blog. What made solving this problem so difficult, exactly? Why did we need to solve it in the first place?
	- When you quickly jot down notes, you’ll probably skip writing down all of the details, because in that moment, you can remember all of it just fine. But when you come back to these notes later, you may have completely forgotten the context in which they were written, and thus these notes will lose some of their value.
	- Understanding and writing down your notes gets you two thirds of the way there. But there's a third thing you need to do to write truly effective notes. Step three involves using the Logseq Daily journals.
- ## Permanent notes
	- TODO write this section and elaborate on linking notes
	- Soon after you’ve jotted down your notes you need to rewrite your notes into “permanent notes” that will live in your slip-box.
	- > A slip-box, also known as a “card index” or “zettelkasten” in German, is where Niklas Luhmann would store all of his permanent notes on index cards. Today, you can also accomplish the same sort of thing thanks to using various software, some even specifically made for Zettelkasten.
	- Each of these notes shouldn’t be excessively long - Luhmann kept things succinct by only using one side of each index card. But at the same time, he made sure that the notes themselves were written properly with full sentences, and were able to be understood without any additional context.
	- As he created more notes, he would find links to other notes he had created, and with a numbering/lettering system would denote certain notes as “sub notes” of other notes. If a note was related to two separate notes, it might be made a sub note of one, and the linkage to the other note would be noted on the index card itself.
	- The act of writing these notes (properly) and finding the connections between them and other notes isn’t easy. It’s a lot harder than just jotting down notes in a notebook and calling it a day. But by doing this expensive brainpower up front, you’re essentially building up a library of interconnected knowledge from the ground-up.
	  
	  As you build up your knowledge library and find the relations between bits of knowledge, the real beauty of this system is that it will organically let you find topics to write about - they essentially will have written themselves because you will have done the work upfront of explaining it in your own words, and connecting it to other notes in your slip-box.
- ## Notes
	- I "just" wanted to:
		- be more organized and efficient
		- communicate better
		- keep important points from meetings organized and at hand
		- keep important configs/info about each project organized and at hand
		- remember and get back to what I've read/studied in a book
		- remember and get back to what I've learned from a talk, an article, a spec, a podcast
		- be better at building my knowledge cake (in layers)
		- create my software engineering journal and tech notes
		- quickly gather and disperse things to build some content (being able to compose different perspectives of the same subject)
		- organize my weekly/monthly/yearly to-do list, which included different groups and context layers: personal/familiar/work/etc.
		- be able to relate things (tags/backlinking)
	- [Ali Abdaal](https://aliabdaal.com/)'s youtube video: [My Simple Productivity System - The Equation](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UAUDcoqK5I4).
		- In this video Ali explains, using a metaphor, that to keep productivity high, you must assume three different roles: The Pilot, the Plane, and the Engineer.
		- While you're the Pilot, you should worry about setting the course of the plane. You should think about what to do during the day (planning). Once you've decided, for the rest of the day, you can enter the "plane" mode.
		- While being the Plane, you should simply focus on following the Pilot's directions. This is where we are 80% of the time, following instructions to achieve our goals according to a pre-defined plan.
		- Last but not least, 5 to 10% of our time should be spent on the skin of the Engineer. While the engineer we should make sure the Plane is efficient, that the system is organized and everything is going as expected.
		- Okay, so all this to say that, before starting to work and taking notes one must be the Engineer (define the system, and the procedures), then be the Pilot (deciding where to fly today and which course we'll take) and in the end, be the Plane (work and take notes accordingly).
